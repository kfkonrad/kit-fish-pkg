## Install

```fish
$ omf install kit
```


## Usage

```fish
$ kit clone git@github.com:fish-shell/fish-shell.git
$ kit clone https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell.git
```

`kit clone` supports the same parameters as `git clone` except that you must not give the optional directory-parameter - `kit clone` will generate that for you.

`kit clone <URL>` will clone the repo to `~/workspace/<domain>/<uri-path>` (e.g. `~/workspace/github/fish-shell/fish-shell`) so that the domain (without TLD) and path in the URL are translated to a path under `~/workspace`. Non-existing intermediary directories will be auto-generated as well. Both https and ssh/git are supported.

```fish
$ kit help
$ kit -h
$ kit --help
```

Shows a rudimentary help.

```fish
$ kit version
$ kit -v
$ kit --version
```
