## Install

```fish
$ omf install kit
```


## Usage

### `kit clone`

```fish
$ kit clone git@github.com:fish-shell/fish-shell.git
$ kit clone https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell.git
```

`kit clone` supports the same parameters as `git clone` except that you must not give the optional directory-parameter - `kit clone` will generate that for you.

`kit clone <URL>` will clone the repo to `~/workspace/<domain>/<uri-path>` (e.g. `~/workspace/github/fish-shell/fish-shell`) so that the domain (without TLD) and path in the URL are translated to a path under `~/workspace`. Non-existing intermediary directories will be auto-generated as well. Both https and ssh/git are supported.

### `kit push`

```fish
$ kit push
```

`kit push` wraps arount git push and sets the `-u`-parameter automatically.
The branch name for `-u` is always the name of the current local branch.
If only one remote is configured, that value will always be used.
If multiple remotes exist, `origin` will be used (regardless of whether a remote with that name exists) unless the user overrides that by setting `$kit_default_remote`.

### `kit help`

```fish
$ kit help
$ kit -h
$ kit --help
```

Shows a rudimentary help.

### `kit version`

```fish
$ kit version
$ kit -v
$ kit --version
```

Displays current version of `kit`.

## Advanced usage

### `kit clone`

- You can change the base directory from `~/workspace` by setting `$kit_base_dir`
- You can customize the behavior for generating the `<domain>`-part by providing a variable with an sed filter expression
- If you want to change the behavior for all domains, set a variable `$kit_domain_filter`
- To change the behavior for a specific domain, set a variable `$kit_domain_filter_<domain>`. Make sure to replace all dots with underscores in the variable name
- A domain-specific filter takes precedence over a custom filter
- The domain being filtered is always the FQDN of the git server, e.g. `github.com` for both `git@github.com:fish-shell/fish-shell.git` and `https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell.git`
- I.e. any schema and URL path is stripped from the input before a filter is applied
- If `$kit_cd_after_clone` is set (to any value), `kit clone` will cd into the newly cloned repo

Examples for filters:
- Not filtering any domain name at all
  - `set kit_domain_filter ""`
  - `github.com/fish-shell/fish/shell` will be cloned into the path `~/workspace/github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell`
  - `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab` will be cloned into the path `~/workspace/gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab`
- Remove the dot in `github.com`
  - `set kit_domain_filter_github_com 's/\.//'`
  - `github.com/fish-shell/fish/shell` will be cloned into the path `~/workspace/githubcom/fish-shell/fish-shell`
  - `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab` will be cloned into the path `~/workspace/gitlab/gitlab-org/gitlab`
- With both of these filters set
  - `github.com/fish-shell/fish/shell` will be cloned into the path `~/workspace/githubcom/fish-shell/fish-shell`
  - `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab` will be cloned into the path `~/workspace/gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab`
